              >Touring is a complex and dynamic process that requires a lot of
              hard work, dedication and preparation. Before the touring itself
              happens, a lot of planning and preparing goes into what will
              happen the night of the concert. This includes booking venues,
              organising transport, arranging accomodation, and hiring crew
              members. This process also includes the music artists warming up
              their vocals, going through their rehersals, fine-tuning their
              preformances and perfecting their choregraphy. The time taken to
              plan and prepare for a tour varies depending on the size and
              complexity of the tour. It generally takes several months to a
              year to plan for a large-scale international scale. One of the
              main reasons why touring can be very exhausting for artists is to
              do with the traveling from one city to another, often across
              different timezones.

              Before each performance, the artists do a soundcheck to ensure
              that everything is and will be working properly. This involves
              testing the sound system, checking the lighting, and adjusting any
              technical issues. Depending on the schedule, artists will offer
              and organise meet and greets for their fans before and after
              performance. This gives the fans an opportunity to interact with
              their favourite artists, take pictures and get autographs.
              Performing infront of their fans can create a personal touch
              because it allows performers to connect with their audience
              emotionally. The preformances are the highlight of the tour, music
              artists can perform for several hours each night, and the energy
              and the excitement you get from the crowd can be exhilarating. Now
              for performance, there's an after party that singers and song
              writers attend to with their crew, fans and celebrities. This
              gives everyone a chance to unwind, celebrate the concert and enjoy
              others company. Touring can be phyiscally and mentally demanding
              so rest and recovery is one of the biggest priorities; which
              includes taking rests, getting enough of sleep, and eating
              properly to ensure they stay healthy and energized throughout the
              rest of the tour. There's a lot that goes into an artist and their
              self-care management.

                Throughout the tours, artists tend to push their vocals to the
                limit when performing which over a long period of time can
                affect their vocal health

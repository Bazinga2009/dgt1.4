              Touring is a complex and dynamic process that requires a lot of
              hard work, dedication and preparation. Before the touring itself
              happens, a lot of planning and preparing goes into what will
              happen the night of the concert. This includes booking venues,
              organising transport, arranging accomodation, and hiring crew
              members. This process also includes the music artists warming up
              their vocals, going through their rehersals, fine-tuning their
              preformances and perfecting their choregraphy. The time taken to
              plan and prepare for a tour varies depending on the size and
              complexity of the tour. It generally takes several months to a
              year to plan for a large-scale international scale. One of the
              main reasons why touring can be very exhausting for artists is to
              do with the traveling from one city to another, often across
              different timezones. Before each performance, the artists do a
              soundcheck to ensure that everything is and will be working
              properly. This involves testing the sound system, checking the
              lighting, and adjusting any technical issues.

              Depending on the schedule, artists will offer and organise meet
              and greets for their fans before and after performance. This gives
              the fans an opportunity to interact with their favourite artists,
              take pictures and get autographs. Performing infront of their fans
              can create a personal touch because it allows performers to
              connect with their audience emotionally. The preformances are the
              highlight of the tour, music artists can perform for several hours
              each night, and the energy and the excitement you get from the
              crowd can be exhilarating. Now for performance, there's an after
              party that singers and song writers attend to with their crew,
              fans and celebrities. This gives everyone a chance to unwind,
              celebrate the concert and enjoy others company. Touring can be
              phyiscally and mentally demanding so rest and recovery is one of
              the biggest priorities; which includes taking rests, getting
              enough of sleep, and eating properly to ensure they stay healthy
              and energized throughout the rest of the tour. There's a lot that
              goes into an artist and their self-care management. Throughout the
              tours, artists tend to push their vocals to the limit when
              performing which can cause vocal strain and severely damage their
              vocal cords. A lot of work goes into warming and strengthening up
              your voice when touring, artists need to do specific exercises to
              improve the stength, flexibility and control of their vocal cords.
              Singers tend to use the humming method to help relax their vocals
              and enhance vibrational patterns. Another important exercise that
              singers need to practise is their breathing. This essentially
              warms up their respiratory system and improving breath support.
